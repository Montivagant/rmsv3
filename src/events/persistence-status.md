# EventStore Persistence Implementation Status

## ✅ Completed
1. **LocalStorage Adapter** - Basic localStorage wrapper with PouchDB-like API
2. **LocalStoragePersistedEventStore** - Event store with localStorage persistence
3. **Persisted Store Factory** - Factory function to create persisted stores
4. **EventStore Context Update** - Context now uses persisted store by default
5. **TypeScript Fixes** - Fixed all type errors

## 🔧 Current Issues
1. **Hydration Not Working** - Events saved to localStorage are not being loaded on initialization
   - The localStorage adapter is working (can save/retrieve)
   - But the hydration process shows "0 events" even after saving
   - This suggests the database names might be mismatched

2. **Test Database Isolation** - Tests are not properly isolated
   - Need to ensure each test uses a unique database name
   - localStorage cleanup between tests needs improvement

## 📝 Working Features
- ✅ Event creation and memory storage
- ✅ Idempotency handling
- ✅ Basic localStorage operations
- ✅ Event store context initialization

## 🚧 Next Steps to Fix Persistence

### Option 1: Simplify Implementation (Recommended)
1. Use a single consistent database name
2. Ensure synchronous persistence on append
3. Add proper await for async operations
4. Fix test isolation

### Option 2: Debug Current Implementation
1. Add logging to track database operations
2. Verify localStorage keys are correct
3. Check if events are actually being saved
4. Debug hydration process step by step

## 💡 Root Cause Analysis
The main issue appears to be that:
1. Events are being saved with one database prefix
2. But hydration is looking for a different prefix
3. The async nature of put() might not complete before tests check

## 🎯 Immediate Fix Needed
To get persistence working for the POS system:
1. Ensure events persist across page refreshes
2. Make sure the POS can recover state after reload
3. Implement proper error handling for storage failures

## 📊 Test Results Summary
- 4/7 tests passing (57% success rate)
- Main failures: Hydration and cross-session persistence
- Idempotency and basic operations working correctly
