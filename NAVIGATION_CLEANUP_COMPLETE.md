## 🗑️ **Phase A: Removed Non-Essential Items**

### **Marketing Module - ENTIRELY REMOVED** ❌
```
❌ Marketing → Promotions (PageStub)
❌ Marketing → Loyalty (PageStub) 
❌ Marketing → Discounts (PageStub)
❌ Marketing → Coupons (PageStub)
❌ Marketing → Gift Cards (PageStub)
❌ Marketing → Timed Events (PageStub)
```
**Reason**: Advanced marketing features not needed for core restaurant operations

### **Menu Advanced Features - REMOVED** ❌
```
❌ Menu → Combos (PageStub)
❌ Menu → Allergens (PageStub)
❌ Menu → Products (duplicate of Items)
```
**Reason**: Complex features not essential for MVP, combos/allergens are advanced

### **Inventory Advanced Features - REMOVED** ❌
```
❌ Inventory → Cost Adjustments (stub: true)
❌ Inventory → Purchase Orders (placeholder)
```
**Reason**: Advanced procurement features, not core for basic restaurant operations

### **Management Non-Essential - REMOVED** ❌
```
❌ Manage → Devices (PageStub)
❌ Manage → More (PageStub)
```
**Reason**: Hardware management and vague "More" category not essential

### **Reports - SIMPLIFIED** ✂️
```
❌ Removed multiple "comingSoon: true" report subitems
✅ Kept core reports: Sales, Inventory, Customer, Business
```
**Reason**: Focus on essential analytics, remove placeholder reports
