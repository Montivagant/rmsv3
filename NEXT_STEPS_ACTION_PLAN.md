## 🔨 Development Approach

### 1. Start with User Workflows
Instead of building features in isolation, implement complete user workflows:

**Workflow 1: Complete Sale**
- Staff logs in → Opens POS → Adds items → Applies discounts → Processes payment → Prints receipt

**Workflow 2: Inventory Check**
- Manager logs in → Views inventory → Checks low stock → Creates purchase order → Receives delivery

**Workflow 3: End of Day**
- Manager logs in → Runs reports → Counts cash → Reconciles → Closes day

### 2. Incremental Feature Development
- Build features incrementally but completely
- Each feature should be usable end-to-end
- Don't move to next feature until current is stable

### 3. Data First Approach
- Ensure data models are correct before UI
- Implement business logic in services
- Keep components focused on presentation
