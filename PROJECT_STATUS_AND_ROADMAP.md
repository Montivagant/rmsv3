## 🚀 Getting Started for Development

### Current Focus Areas:
1. **Stabilize existing features** before adding new ones
2. **Fix critical bugs** in EventStore and PouchDB
3. **Complete POS workflow** end-to-end
4. **Implement inventory tracking** basics

### Development Priorities:
1. **High**: POS, Payments, Inventory
2. **Medium**: KDS, Reporting, Loyalty
3. **Low**: Advanced integrations, Multi-location

### Key Decisions Needed:
1. Which payment providers to integrate?
2. Cloud vs on-premise deployment?
3. Real-time sync strategy?
4. Offline-first approach extent?
5. Third-party integrations priority?

## 📝 Notes

- The project uses an event-sourced architecture which provides excellent audit trails but adds complexity
- PouchDB/CouchDB sync can enable multi-location support with conflict resolution
- The modular structure allows for gradual feature rollout
- Consider microservices for scaling specific modules independently
