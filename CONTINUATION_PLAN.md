# RMS v3 Continuation Plan - January 2025

## üìç Current State Assessment

### ‚úÖ What's Working
1. **Core Infrastructure**
   - EventStore with in-memory storage
   - Event-driven architecture
   - React context providers
   - Development server running

2. **POS Module** 
   - Basic order creation
   - Item management
   - Payment processing (basic)
   - UI components

3. **Test Infrastructure**
   - Core tests passing (10/10)
   - POS workflow tests (4/6 passing)
   - Test utilities configured

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Issues to Fix
1. **Event Persistence**
   - Events save to localStorage but don't hydrate on reload
   - Storage statistics not working
   - Cross-session persistence failing

2. **POS Calculations**
   - Tax calculation precision issues
   - Order workflow aggregate retrieval

3. **Missing Features**
   - Receipt generation
   - Cash payment with change
   - Inventory tracking
   - Kitchen Display System

## üöÄ Immediate Actions (Today)

### Priority 1: Fix Event Persistence (1-2 hours)
The main issue is that events are being saved with one database name but hydration looks for another.

**Steps:**
1. Fix database name consistency in `localStoragePersisted.ts`
2. Ensure synchronous save operations
3. Fix hydration process to properly load events
4. Add error handling and logging

**Files to modify:**
- `src/events/localStoragePersisted.ts`
- `src/events/persistedStore.ts`
- `src/db/localStorage.ts`

### Priority 2: Complete POS Payment Flow (2-3 hours)
Add missing payment features for a complete sale workflow.

**Steps:**
1. Implement cash payment with change calculation
2. Add card payment stub
3. Create split payment functionality
4. Add payment validation

**Files to create/modify:**
- `src/payments/cashPayment.ts`
- `src/payments/cardPayment.ts`
- `src/payments/splitPayment.ts`
- `src/pages/POS.tsx` (update payment modal)

### Priority 3: Receipt Generation (1-2 hours)
Create receipt functionality for completed orders.

**Steps:**
1. Design receipt template
2. Implement receipt generator
3. Add print functionality
4. Create email receipt option

**Files to create:**
- `src/receipts/template.tsx`
- `src/receipts/generator.ts`
- `src/receipts/printer.ts`
- `src/components/ReceiptModal.tsx`

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Improvements

### 1. Fix Persistence Architecture
```typescript
// Proposed fix for localStorage persistence
class LocalStoragePersistedEventStore {
  private readonly DB_NAME = 'rmsv3_events'; // Consistent name
  
  async hydrate(): Promise<void> {
    const keys = Object.keys(localStorage)
      .filter(key => key.startsWith(this.DB_NAME));
    
    for (const key of keys) {
      const event = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem(key) || '{}');
      await this.store.append(event);
    }
  }
  
  async append(event: Event): Promise<void> {
    await this.store.append(event);
    localStorage.setItem(
      `${this.DB_NAME}_${event.id}`,
      JSON.stringify(event)
    );
  }
}
```

### 2. Payment Processing Flow
```typescript
interface PaymentProcessor {
  processPayment(amount: number, method: PaymentMethod): Promise<PaymentResult>;
  calculateChange(tendered: number, total: number): number;
  validatePayment(payment: Payment): ValidationResult;
  splitPayment(total: number, splits: PaymentSplit[]): SplitResult;
}
```

### 3. Receipt Generation
```typescript
interface ReceiptGenerator {
  generate(order: Order): Receipt;
  format(receipt: Receipt): string;
  print(receipt: Receipt): Promise<void>;
  email(receipt: Receipt, email: string): Promise<void>;
}
```

## üß™ Testing Strategy

### Immediate Test Fixes
1. Fix tax calculation precision in `pos-workflow.test.ts`
2. Fix aggregate retrieval in workflow tests
3. Add persistence integration tests
4. Create E2E test for complete sale

### Test Coverage Goals
- Unit tests: 80% coverage
- Integration tests: Critical paths
- E2E tests: Main workflows

## üìä Success Metrics

### This Week
- [ ] All tests passing (23/23)
- [ ] Event persistence working across refreshes
- [ ] Complete POS sale workflow functional
- [ ] Receipt generation working

### Next Week
- [ ] Basic inventory tracking
- [ ] Kitchen Display System MVP
- [ ] Daily reports functional
- [ ] Multi-terminal support

## üîß Technical Debt to Address

### High Priority
1. Fix event persistence hydration
2. Standardize error handling
3. Add proper logging system
4. Fix TypeScript strict mode issues

### Medium Priority
1. Implement proper dependency injection
2. Add service layer abstraction
3. Create data migration tools
4. Optimize bundle size

### Low Priority
1. Add performance monitoring
2. Implement caching strategy
3. Create developer tools
4. Add analytics tracking

## üíª Development Workflow

### Daily Tasks
1. **Morning**: Fix critical bugs
2. **Midday**: Implement new features
3. **Afternoon**: Write tests
4. **Evening**: Documentation updates

### Code Review Checklist
- [ ] Tests passing

- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Error handling present
- [ ] Performance acceptable

## üö¶ Go/No-Go Decisions

### Before Production
1. **Functionality**
   - Can process 100+ sales without errors
   - Inventory tracking accurate
   - Reports match transactions

2. **Performance**
   - Page load < 2 seconds
   - Transaction < 500ms
   - 100+ concurrent users

3. **Reliability**
   - Works offline
   - Syncs when online
   - Zero data loss

## üìù Questions to Resolve

### Business Requirements
1. Which payment processors to integrate?
2. Receipt format requirements?
3. Tax calculation rules?
4. Inventory tracking granularity?

### Technical Decisions
1. Database strategy (IndexedDB vs localStorage)?
2. Sync mechanism (WebSocket vs polling)?
3. Deployment target (cloud vs on-premise)?
4. Backup strategy?

## üéØ Next Session Focus

**Recommended Approach:**
1. **First**: Fix event persistence (foundation for everything)
2. **Second**: Complete POS payment flow
3. **Third**: Add receipt generation
4. **Fourth**: Start inventory tracking

## üìà Progress Tracking

### Today's Goals
- [ ] Fix event persistence hydration
- [ ] Add cash payment with change
- [ ] Create receipt template
- [ ] Update documentation

### This Week's Milestones
- [ ] Week 1: Core fixes + POS completion
- [ ] Week 2: Inventory + KDS basics
- [ ] Week 3: Reports + Multi-location
- [ ] Week 4: Polish + Production prep

## üîÑ Implementation Order

1. **Fix Persistence** (Critical - blocks everything)
2. **Complete Payments** (Required for POS)
3. **Add Receipts** (Customer requirement)
4. **Implement Inventory** (Business critical)
5. **Build KDS** (Kitchen operations)
6. **Create Reports** (Management needs)
7. **Add Multi-location** (Scaling)

**Ready to Start?** 
The first priority is fixing event persistence. Once that's working, the entire system becomes much more stable and we can rapidly add features.

**Estimated Time to MVP:** 2 weeks
**Estimated Time to Production:** 4 weeks
