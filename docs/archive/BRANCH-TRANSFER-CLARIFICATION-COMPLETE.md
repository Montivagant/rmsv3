---

## 🔍 **BUSINESS LOGIC ANALYSIS**

### **✅ Current Data Structure - ALREADY CORRECT**

The underlying data was **already correctly structured** for branch-to-branch transfers:

```typescript
export interface Location {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  type: 'restaurant' | 'warehouse' | 'central_kitchen' | 'commissary';
  address?: string;
  isActive: boolean;
}
```

### **✅ Mock Branch Locations - ENHANCED**

```typescript
// Updated branch locations for clarity
const locations: Location[] = [
  {
    id: 'main-restaurant',
    name: 'Main Restaurant',
    type: 'restaurant',
    address: '123 Main St, Downtown',
    isActive: true
  },
  {
    id: 'downtown-branch',       // ✅ Changed from 'downtown-location'
    name: 'Downtown Branch',     // ✅ Clear branch terminology
    type: 'restaurant',
    address: '456 Downtown Ave',
    isActive: true
  },
  {
    id: 'westside-branch',       // ✅ Added new restaurant branch
    name: 'Westside Branch',
    type: 'restaurant', 
    address: '789 West Side Blvd',
    isActive: true
  },
  {
    id: 'central-warehouse',
    name: 'Central Warehouse',
    type: 'warehouse',
    address: '789 Industrial Blvd',
    isActive: true
  },
  {
    id: 'central-kitchen',
    name: 'Central Kitchen',
    type: 'central_kitchen',
    address: '321 Kitchen Way',
    isActive: true
  }
];
```

```

### **✅ Dropdown Options - ENHANCED**
```typescript

const locationOptions = [
  { value: '', label: 'All Branches' },
  ...(locations || []).map(loc => ({
    value: loc.id,
    label: `${loc.name} (${loc.type})`  // ✅ Shows branch type
  }))
];

// Result: "Main Restaurant (restaurant)", "Central Warehouse (warehouse)"
```
