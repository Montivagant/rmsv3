# Build Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

1. **DataTable Import in CategoryManagement.tsx**
   - Problem: The CategoryManagement component was trying to import `DataTable` from the main components index, but it wasn't exported there
   - Solution: Updated the import to correctly reference the DataTable component from `src/components/inventory/DataTable`

2. **CategoryCreateModal Export Issue**
   - Problem: The CategoryCreateModal component was exported as default but imported as a named export
   - Solution: Created a proper re-export file (`src/components/categories/index.ts`) to correctly expose the component

3. **DataTable Interface Mismatch**
   - Problem: The CategoryManagement component was using the DataTable with incorrect props
   - Solution: Updated the columns definition and DataTable usage to match the actual component interface

## Changes Made

1. Updated imports in `src/pages/inventory/CategoryManagement.tsx`:
   ```typescript
   // Changed from
   import { DataTable } from '../../components';
   // To
   import { DataTable } from '../../components/inventory/DataTable';
   
   // Changed from
   import { CategoryCreateModal } from '../../components/categories/CategoryCreateModal';
   // To
   import { CategoryCreateModal } from '../../components/categories';
   ```

2. Created a new re-export file at `src/components/categories/index.ts`:
   ```typescript
   /**
    * Re-export category components
    */
   
   export { default as CategoryCreateModal } from './CategoryCreateModal';
   ```

3. Updated the DataTable usage to match its interface:
   - Changed column definitions to use `key` instead of `accessorKey`
   - Changed from `cell: (info) => info.getValue()` to `accessor: (category) => category.name`
   - Added `keyExtractor` prop to the DataTable component
   - Removed unsupported props (`sortable`, `pagination`)

## Results

- Build now completes successfully
- Development server runs without errors
- The CategoryManagement component can be properly loaded in the application
