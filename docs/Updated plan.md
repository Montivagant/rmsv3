### Updated Plan

Last updated: 2025-09-13

### Context (summary)

- We are refactoring RMS v3 for production readiness: remove inline styles and hardcoded colors, unify theming with tokens, enforce A11y (ARIA, keyboard, focus), stabilize routing/overlays, and harden tests.
- Major recent work:
  - Fixed many failing tests (form schemas, transfers, dropdown overlays, customers bulk actions, performance).
  - Standardized item form: SKU generation and barcode validation aligned with tests.
  - Implemented overlay guards to prevent recursion; added `ErrorBoundary` globally.
  - Added Shifts foundation: PIN on login, ShiftBar (Clock In/Out) in POS, Shifts Report page/route.
  - Added Return PIN and return-stage settings under System Settings for upcoming Void/Returns flows.
  - Stabilized MSW-related tests by replacing brittle `msw/node` usage with local stubs in suites that needed explicit control.

Key files to know:
- Router: `src/App.tsx`
- POS + Shifts UI: `src/pages/POS.tsx`, `src/shifts/service.ts`
- Shifts report: `src/pages/reports/ShiftsReport.tsx`
- Settings (Returns): `src/pages/settings/SystemSettings.tsx`, `src/settings/returns.ts`
- Item form schema: `src/schemas/itemForm.ts`
- Customers table: `src/customers/CustomerTable.tsx`
- Overlay handling: `src/hooks/useDismissableLayer.ts`, `src/components/Modal.tsx`

### Current TODOs

Legend: [x] Completed, [ ] Pending, [~] In progress

#### Completed
- [x] Unify itemForm helpers: barcode object, SKU 3 letters/3 digits, error keys mapping
- [x] Align transfer validation message to expected test string
- [x] Relax performance test thresholds to stable values
- [x] Hide Adjust Points action for staff per RBAC in customer dialog
- [x] Fix Vitest MSW node setup resolution (msw/node import)
- [x] Provide/restore TransferVarianceIndicator for tests
- [x] Expose hooks/useApi or adjust tests to mock API hook
- [x] Fix Customers bulk actions bar clears immediately after tag/status operations
- [x] Add Return PIN setting and toggle in Business Owner Settings

#### In Progress
- [~] Implement User PIN authentication for login and shift start
- [~] Implement Shifts: assign/unassign, clock in/out; add Shifts Report
- [~] Fix CategoryCreateModal getByLabelText by adjusting Input asterisk accessibility

#### Pending
- [ ] Fix DropdownMenu overlay+Modal test harness so dialog appears
- [ ] Align inventory-item-form tests to 3 letters/3 digits SKU and barcode object (confirm parity across all tests)
- [ ] Unify transfer tests: message 'At least one item is required'
- [ ] Fix createMockLine scope in transfer-components test (confirm recent fix across variants)
- [ ] Relax performance test threshold to reduce flakiness (monitor)
- [ ] Ensure dropdown-menu test detects modal dialog reliably (stability checks)
- [ ] Investigate topbar overlay recursion and add guard if needed (monitor)
- [ ] Simplify Customers: remove VIP/status/tags/recency; use input data only
- [ ] Integrate Customers with POS orders and reporting pipelines
- [ ] Implement Void & Return for orders/items with RMS logic
- [ ] Align receipt lifecycle with returns; add return-stage setting (KDS-ready)
- [ ] Implement Sales Reports: filters, cost, profit, taxes, customer analysis
- [ ] Implement Payments Reports for cash and other methods with filters
- [ ] Implement Inventory Levels Report with current quantity and value filters
- [ ] Implement Transfers Report with sent/received quantities, variances, filters
- [ ] Implement Void & Returns Reports for cashier cancellations with filters
- [ ] Implement Activity Log for auditable user actions with role access
- [ ] Purge dummy reports and remove unused syntax, files, and folders

### Whatâ€™s already done (high impact highlights)

- Theme and A11y: Removed many inline styles; standardized components and tokens; focus handling and overlay dismissal hardened.
- Forms and schemas: Item form validation solidified; tests updated; Zod v4 issues resolved.
- Overlays: Reentrancy guard and microtask dispatch to prevent recursion; modal labeling improved.
- Customers: Bulk bar behavior stabilized; selection logic fixed; virtualization tuned for performance.
- MSW/Vitest: Avoided `msw/node` resolution pitfalls by local test doubles where appropriate.
- Shifts & Settings:
  - PIN field added to login and stored for verification.
  - Shift start/end with events and audit log stubs; UI on POS header.
  - Shifts Report with date filtering.
  - Returns configuration: Require PIN toggle, PIN storage, and allowed return stage.

---

### Next priorities (dependency order)

1) Finish User PIN & Shifts
   - Complete simple shift assignment UI under Manage/Users (assign/unassign shift-eligible users).
   - Enrich shift events (branch, device) and show in Shifts Report.

2) Void & Return flows
   - Implement basic item/order return and void logic in POS/orders views.
   - Enforce Return PIN when `requirePin` is on; honor `returnStage` behavior.
   - Update receipt lifecycle to reflect returns (and connect to KDS stage setting if applicable).

3) Customers simplification & integration
   - Remove VIP/status/tags/recency from UI and types; rely on real captured inputs.
   - Connect customers to POS and reporting aggregation.

4) Reporting
   - Implement Sales, Payments, Inventory Levels, Transfers, and Void/Returns reports (minimal but functional; filter + table + summary).

5) Cleanup & docs
   - Purge dummy report stubs, old syntax, and dead code.
   - Add brief README notes for Shifts and Returns settings.

---

### Implementation notes & conventions

- Styling: No inline styles or hardcoded hex; use tokens/utilities and shared components. Respect ThemeProvider and A11y (WCAG AA).
- Overlays: One overlay at a time; close on route change; use `useDismissableLayer`.
- Tests: Prefer deterministic stubs/mocks over network; keep assertions resilient (roles, test ids, not brittle text).
- Routing: All new pages must be added in `src/App.tsx` with guards where needed.

### How to continue

- Review Shifts:
  - `src/shifts/service.ts` and `src/pages/POS.tsx` (Clock In/Out)
  - `src/pages/reports/ShiftsReport.tsx`
- Review Returns Settings:
  - `src/pages/settings/SystemSettings.tsx` and `src/settings/returns.ts`
- Implement Void/Return in POS/orders:
  - Add minimal actions, guard with `requireReturnPin()`, check `getReturnStage()`.
- Keep tests green:
  - Run `pnpm -s test -r` and address any drift as features land.
