# RMSv3 Project Summary

## Overview

This document serves as an index to the comprehensive analysis and implementation plan for the RMSv3 (Restaurant Management System) project. The focus is on transforming the system into an offline-first application with robust sync capabilities while addressing numerous UI and functionality issues.

2. **[TASKS_TODO.md](TASKS_TODO.md)**: Prioritized task list (P0/P1/P2) with clear steps and acceptance criteria.

3. **[RMSv3-SSOT.md](docs/RMSv3-SSOT.md)**: Single Source of Truth for business and technical logic, including architectural decisions.

4. **[IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN-2025-09-14.md](plans/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN-2025-09-14.md)**: Initial phased implementation plan with timeline and dependencies.

5. **[REFINED_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN-2025-09-14.md](plans/REFINED_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN-2025-09-14.md)**: Updated plan addressing specific UI and functionality issues.

6. **[COMPREHENSIVE_TODO_LIST.md](COMPREHENSIVE_TODO_LIST.md)**: Detailed task list organized by implementation phase.

## Core Architectural Changes

1. **Offline-First Architecture**:
   - Local database with PouchDB/IndexedDB
   - Outbox pattern for pending operations
   - Online triggers for synchronization
   - Conflict resolution strategies
   - Periodic database compaction

2. **Event Sourcing Improvements**:
   - Typed events with zod validation
   - Event versioning for schema evolution
   - Strong CQRS separation with projections

3. **Technical Debt Reduction**:
   - Strict TypeScript configuration
   - Centralized logging (no console.log)
   - Modern React Router with data loading
   - Feature-first code organization

4. **UI/UX Enhancements**:
   - Fixed dashboard with live data
   - Streamlined navigation
   - Proper notification system
   - Consistent styling across forms

## Business Model Improvements

1. **Role-Based Access Control**:
   - One Business Owner per tenant
   - Custom role creation with permission assignment
   - Module-level access control

2. **Technical Admin Dashboard**:
   - Tenant management capabilities
   - Module enablement per tenant
   - Business account administration

3. **Menu-Inventory Integration**:
   - Menu Items reference Inventory Items by ID
   - Bill of Materials for composite items
   - No duplicate SKUs

4. **Feature Optimizations**:
   - Removal of Loyalty module
   - Enhanced Inventory Audit functionality
   - Improved POS-KDS integration

## Implementation Timeline

The implementation is organized into 11 phases with an estimated duration of 18-24 weeks (4-6 months):

1. **Phase 0**: Cleanup & Guardrails (1-2 weeks)
2. **Phase 1**: Data & Sync Foundations (3-4 weeks)
3. **Phase 2**: Dashboard Fixes (1-2 weeks)
4. **Phase 3**: Navigation & Header Cleanup (1 week)
5. **Phase 4**: Roles & Multi-tenant (2-3 weeks)
6. **Phase 5**: Technical Admin Dashboard (2 weeks)
7. **Phase 6**: Inventory & Menu Structure (2 weeks)
8. **Phase 7**: Menu Item Model (2-3 weeks)
9. **Phase 8**: POS & Customers (2 weeks)
10. **Phase 9**: Remove Loyalty (3 days)
11. **Phase 10**: Business/Settings Cleanup (1 week)
12. **Phase 11**: Tests & CI Hardening (2 weeks)

## Next Steps

1. Review and prioritize the comprehensive TODO list
2. Begin Phase 0 implementation (project cleanup and guardrails)
3. Set up offline-first architecture foundations
4. Address most critical UI/functionality issues first

## Success Metrics

- **Offline Functionality**: 100% of core features work without internet
- **Sync Reliability**: >99% sync success rate
- **Performance**: Dashboard loads in <2s; POS operations <500ms
- **Test Coverage**: >80% unit test coverage; all critical paths with E2E tests
- **User Satisfaction**: Positive feedback on role management and inventory integration
